## Task 3
**( Huskylens )**
a smart device that uses artificial intelligence for object recognition, face recognition, color detection, and motion tracking.
It can be connected to an Arduino Uno to create smart robotic projects.

**How to Set Up HUSKYLENS with Arduino Uno and Use Object Recognition:**

**1. Set Up HUSKYLENS:**

Connect the HUSKYLENS device to the Arduino Uno.
When powered on, the device will display what the camera sees on the screen.


**2. Download the Code to Arduino:**

Install the Huskylens library for Arduino via the Arduino IDE.


**3. Object Recognition:**

After uploading the library to Arduino Uno, open the HUSKYLENS app.

Select "Object Recognition" mode.

Point the camera at the object you want to train it on, and press the button to teach it.


**4. Using HUSKYLENS with Arduino:**

Once the object is recognized, the Arduino will display the objectâ€™s name on the screen.

If the object is successfully recognized, the Arduino will print the name in the Serial Monitor.


## **Summary:**
Connect HUSKYLENS to Arduino Uno using the appropriate wiring.
Upload the Arduino code for object recognition.
Train HUSKYLENS on objects using the HUSKYLENS app.
Once the objects are recognized, Arduino can use the information to perform specific actions.
